### Project Title
US-Bikeshare-Data

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
I import the data from csv files containing data for each city and answerd important questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
It provides an interactive experience for users such that they can decide how to filter the data.

### Files used
Randomly selected data for the all three cities in .csv format ('chicago.csv'; 'new_york_city.csv'; 'washington.csv').These datas are already given.

### The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
 Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
 Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
 End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
 User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

 ### Project Submission
The developed CLI program allows the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database.
 The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday,
 in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data.
 The user is also able to chose to view raw data and to sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.
