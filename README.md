### Project Title
US-Bikeshare-Data

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I import the data from csv files containing data for each city and answerd important questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.

### Files used
Randomly selected data for the all three cities in .csv format ('chicago.csv'; 'new_york_city.csv'; 'washington.csv').These datas are already given.

### Credits
This project was done as part of Udacity's Nanodegree - Programming for Data Science with Python. Starter code, instructions and clean datasets were provided by Udacity.
