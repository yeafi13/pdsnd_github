### Project Title
US-Bikeshare-Data

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
I import the data from csv files containing data for each city and answerd important questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
It provides an interactive experience for users such that they can decide how to filter the data.

### Files used
Randomly selected data for the all three cities in .csv format ('chicago.csv'; 'new_york_city.csv'; 'washington.csv').These datas are already given.

### The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
 Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
 Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
 End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
 User Type (Subscriber or Customer)


### Credits
This project was done as part of Udacity's Nanodegree - Programming for Data Science with Python. Starter code, instructions and clean datasets were provided by Udacity.

### Softwares needed:
Python , NumPy, and Pandas installed using Anaconda,A text editor, like VS Code or Atom.,A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

### The Datasets
The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for all three cities.
